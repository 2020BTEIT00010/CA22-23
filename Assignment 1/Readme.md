Write a modular algorithm "Quick Sort" with at least three functions(modules) for sorting given 'n' numbers. Compute a total number of comparisons used in the program for different values of n (10, 100, 1000, 10000) and comment on the complexity of the algorithm. 
Hint use: Profiler 'gprof', visit the link below for more information on the profiling tool, 'gprof'. 

Upload 3 files
1. The algorithm
2. Profile output for any 'n' value
3. An 'observation.txt' text file containing your say on 
       - if we can decide the sequence of functions executed from 'gprof' 
       - Comment on the complexity of the algorithm 

Copying in any form in the above submission will be treated seriously.
