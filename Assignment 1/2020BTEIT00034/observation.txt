Obeservation:

    After running the program for different types of input, whether it be the size of array or elements inside it. Here are the obeservations:
        1. Quick Sort is an divide and conquer algorithm.
        2. Worst case occurs when all the elements inside the array are sorted and time complexity is O(n^2)
        3. The time complexity is directly related to size of the array.
        4. In the output file (attached along with these) I've choosen the array size as 1000 and the number of function calls are 10061, while 8705 primitive calls.
        5. The code got executed in less than 3 seconds, but if we increase the value of n(size of the array) then the execution time will increase, and vice versa.
